| Data                   | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |

| Heroku api key         | You can get it at [Account Settings](https://dashboard.heroku.com/account) all the way down. You need this in order to call the Heroku api.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| Heroku app name        | This will appear in the mod, the url of the server will be `https://${appname}.herokuapp.com`.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| Discord webhook url    | This is the url where the server will send the ratted info once it passes through the checks. You can create it by going into a channel's settings and into `Integrations > Webhooks > Create Webhook` and copy the webhook url from there.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| MongoDB database url   | This is the url where the server will save the ratted info once it passes through the checks. You can create a new MongoDB account and database for free and use the connect button to get your url. In the end it should look something like this, `mongodb+srv://${username}:${password}@database.${database_id}.mongodb.net/${collection}`. database_id is automatically generated in the url. collection is just a name where it will save data (kind of like a table). |
| Mod modid              | This is an id for the mod. It is required for Forge to identify and send it to Hypixel as part of your mod list. Typically, you'd want to choose something that seems trusted and well-known. You can imagine this as a name but under the hood. Some modids are banned and Hypixel will not let you enter the server with them.                                                                                                                                            |
| Full path of the jar   | If you are injecting, this is the full path to the jar you want to inject into. Typically, it should look like this `C:\Users\dxxxxy\Downloads\${jarname}.jar` with the path being your own.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| Full name of the class | If you are injecting, this is the path inside the jar where the class will be injected. For example, if you want the class to be hidden inside `qol.randomclient.features` with the class name `Nuker`, this will look like this: `qol.randomclient.features.Nuker`.                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
